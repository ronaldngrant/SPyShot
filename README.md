Python program, takes screenshot and sends file to email address defined.
PILL needs to installed for this implementaion to work, I am using a 64bit version of Python, the PILL version needs to match the Python version. As of today (20.05.2016), I am using "Python 3.4.3 x64" and PILL version "Pillow-2.5.3.win-amd64-py3.4".

Pillow Version being used 
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.5.3

Python Version being used
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-343/

All respect goes out to the creators of Python and Pillow. I created none of these pieces of software. All I did was string some simple commands together to keet track of what my 7 year old sister does on the laptop.
